          Restry is a project I decided to work on after I ran out of post-its
          to write my to-do list for the day, I also needed a timer to break my
          work into chunks but couldn't find an app that offered these two
          functionalities. This project helped improve my knowledge of React
          Hooks and the component lifecycle as a whole. This also highlighted
          the importance of test-driven development to me and I couldn't be a
          better ambassador.

          <aside class="callout bg-oyster-pink">
            Apart from the fact that I needed an app to help with my
            productivity, I also needed to solidify my React Knowledge. For
            example, I didn't know the useEffect hook accepted a cleanup
            function and while building the timer, I was tripped up by this very
            fact.

          <h2>Why I chose this tech stack</h2>
          <aside class="callout bg-eggshell">
            I started out using Vanilla JavaScript and React for this but as the
            project grew in complexity, I had to port everything over to
            TypeScript. One particular bug with the task items receiving the
            wrong props without my knowledge helped clarify this decision.
            <br />
            I also chose Sass over vanilla CSS because I wanted to implement
            aesthetic logic but didn't want to go overkill with JS.<br />
            React was a no-brainer for me because I needed re-usable components
            and had to do some state <em>jiu-jitsu</em> which would have been
            unnecesarily complex with vanilla JS.

        <h2>Problems and Improvements.</h2>
        <p class="spaced-text">
          This app was undoubtedly the most ambitious challenge I've ever taken
          on (excluding trying to build GTA on my own) and I ran into a number
          of problems. One of the most notable ones was synchronising the timer
          animation with the countdown.
        </p>
        <p class="spaced-text">
          When I got the timer to work, the animation skipped steps. When I
          squashed the animation bug, the timer would just jump through time
          exponentially. It was a very weird game of <em>whack-a-mole</em> but
          in the end I found the cause of the bug within my useEffect hook.
        </p>
        <p class="spaced-text">
          I'm currently building some new features to improve the user
          experience. I'm planning on sending the user a notification when the
          timer runs out and also allowin them modify the duration of the timer.
          Down the line, I hope to integrate gamification through unlockable
          achievements to encourage the user's productivity habits.
