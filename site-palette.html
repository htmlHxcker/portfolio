					As a developer who frequently needs to reference color schemes from
					existing websites, I found that existing tools were either paid or
					lacking in features. This led me to create Site Colour Palette
					Extractor - a Chrome extension that makes it easy to extract, analyze,
					and export color palettes from any website. The tool distinguishes
					between background and text colors, shows usage frequency, and
					supports multiple export formats to fit into various design workflows.

					<h2>Why did I build this</h2>
					<aside class="callout bg-oyster-pink">
						The project was born from a real need in the web development
						community. While working on projects that required matching existing
						color schemes, I noticed the lack of a simple, free tool that could
						quickly extract and format colors in various ways. This extension
						fills that gap, making it easier for developers and designers to
						understand and implement color schemes from existing websites.

					<h2>Why I chose this tech stack</h2>
					<aside class="callout bg-eggshell">
						I deliberately chose vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for this
						project to ensure maximum performance and minimal bundle size. The
						extension needed to be lightweight and quick to load, as it would be
						analyzing pages in real-time. This approach also allowed me to have
						complete control over the implementation without the overhead of
						additional frameworks.

				<h2>Problems and Improvements</h2>
				<p class="spaced-text">
					One of the main challenges was implementing the various export
					formats, especially PDF and ASE (Adobe Swatch Exchange) formats, which
					required diving deep into file format specifications and binary data
					handling.
				</p>
				<p class="spaced-text">
					Building a robust offline functionality was another challenge. I
					implemented manual color conversion functions (RGB to HSL/HEX) as
					fallbacks when the external API is unavailable, ensuring the extension
					remains functional without internet access.
				</p>
				<p class="spaced-text">
					Data serialization for storage proved challenging, particularly when
					preserving color type information (background vs. text). This required
					careful consideration of data structures and storage optimization to
					maintain a smooth user experience.
