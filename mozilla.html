          I had the amazing opportunity to work at Mozilla as an intern. During
          this period, I worked alongside the Firefox Devtools team to help
          improve the Network requests tab. This gave me the opportunity to work
          with senior developers and designers alike and gave me first-hand
          experience of what it's like to work with other people in a
          professional setting. Throughout this period, I was constantly
          challenged in all aspects and I was able to come out as a more refined
          developer (and Potterhead).

        <p class="spaced-text">
          Before going into this internship, I wrote down a list of goals I
          wanted to achieve both personally and professionally. I was still
          getting used to Git and working collaboratively with a team. It was
          also during this internship I began to learn React and the more
          intricate parts of Vanilla JavaScript like async/await.
        </p>
        <p class="spaced-text">
          This internship also introduced me to the less technical side of being
          a developer. Concepts like ideation, Agile methodologies, asking for
          PR reviews and working with the sugeestions of others. Most
          importantly, I learnt how to read code written by others and find my
          way around larger codebases.

      <section class="project-section-wrapper lessons">
        <h2 class="fs-600">Lessons learned</h2>
        <p class="spaced-text">
          The amount of things I learnt from this internship are innumerable,
          but a few experiences stand out.
        </p>
        <p class="spaced-text">
          I learnt how to work with design systems, and how to structure larger
          codebases. I also learnt how writing sloppy code can come back to
          haunt you even earlier than expected. I also learnt how to work with
          JSDoc for documenting code.
        </p>
        <p class="spaced-text">
          I now spend a lot of time refactoring and improving my code to make
          sure that hopefully years from now, it'll still make sense to me or
          anyone else going through my code.
