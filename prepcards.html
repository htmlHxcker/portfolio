					I recently began learning Japanese (Â≠ê„Å´„Å°„Çè!) and people kept
					recommending the use of a flashcard application to help with
					practicing but most weren't free, the ones that were free were very
					frustrating to use and so I decided I'd just build one for myself.
					This was the first project I built after learning React and it helped
					me understand its core principles. From reusable components to
					managing state across multiple components effectively.

					<h2>Why did I build this</h2>
					<aside class="callout bg-oyster-pink">
						This was the first project I ever built with React and it was a huge
						shift in terms of mindset compared to vanilla JS and any other
						library I had ever tried. I was basically lost in the React jungle
						and this helped me make sense of a lot of things. I experienced
						props drilling first hand and found a solution to it, I also went
						under the hood by using just webpack instead of create-react-app.

					<h2>Why I chose this tech stack</h2>
					<aside class="callout bg-eggshell">
						Although only vanilla JavaScript is allowed for building Chrome
						extensions, after preparing a list of features I wanted the
						extension to have, it wasn't long before I realized this was a job
						better suited to React.
						<br />
						A lot of the UI Components were reusable, managing the state of the
						app and keeping that state handy for when the user modified the app,
						all these were features that made React a natural choice for me.
						<br />
						I decided to go with Redux for state management because props
						drilling was becoming a serious issue. The state itself was quite
						complex and I figured React's useContext hook may not cut it.

				<h2>Problems and Improvements.</h2>
				<p class="spaced-text">
					This was my first experience with the "it works on my machine"
					phenomenom. Due to the fact that the Chrome extension API was very
					different from the native Browser API, I had a very convoluted
					development process.
				</p>
				<p class="spaced-text">
					I would work on a new feature and have no idea if my code worked, I'd
					have to run the build step, reload the extension in the browser and
					only then would my changes be reflected offering me a rather humbling
					glimpse into life before hot-reloading. üòÖ
				</p>
				<p class="spaced-text">
					I also faced some issues when working on the CRUD functionality.
					Chrome offers a storage API similar to localStorage but manipulating
					it wasn't exactly easy so I had to build custom hooks and utilities to
					make the process a bit smoother. Now, I'm building a spaced-reptition
					algorithm to aid the review process.
